The Beavers Trust were recently made aware of the sad news of the passing of long time club servant Robbie Brownett. Robbie passed away at his home in Sunbury following declining health recently. 

Robbie had served the club for many years, starting in the 60s in various roles and always ready to help wherever needed. He was likely the club's first full-time employee, taking on the role of running the bar in the 70s. Robbie also served on the club's committee for several years. Most recently, you would have seen him as part of the operations team, assisting with car parking and welcoming visitors to Beveree as a steward—a role he continued until a couple of seasons ago. Robbie was also the driving force behind the club’s 200 Club, giving supporters the chance to help the club and win some cash too!

Robbie will be much missed, both on home and away matchdays as well as by his friends and family. 

**Those who wish to pay their respects can do so at the funeral which will take place on Monday 3rd June at [South West Middlesex Crematorium (Hanworth)](https://www.swmcrematorium.gov.uk/), staring at 2.20pm, then afterwards at Beveree.**

The family have asked for no flowers but instead supporters can make a donation in Robbie’s memory to the Beavers Trust, who work on behalf of supporters with the club and within the local community. 

If you would like to make a donation you can do so [online](https://hampton-richmond-borough-fc-supporters-society-limit.sumupstore.com/product/in-memory-robbie-brownett) or if would prefer to give cash please see a member of the supporter’s trust [board](https://thebeaverstrust.com/board/). 


Thank you, Robbie, for your work, passion and commitment to the Beavers, your memory will live on.
