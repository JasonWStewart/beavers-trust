## NEW SEASON, FRESH HOPE
It's a new season with all the excitement that brings and we're delighted to have Alan Julian in charge assisted by Donovan Chislett and Luke Ruddick. Alan and Luke have been great Hampton servants and should create a real bond with fans this season. We're sure all fans will join us in wishing Alan, his staff and all the new players the best of luck for the season, we will be right behind you all the way.

## CLUB PARTNERSHIP
With the changes in the Club boardroom we've been encouraged by recent conversations and potential partnership initiatives for this season. Here are details of a few things we've been working on.

## PLAYER SPONSORSHIP

We hope to partner with the Club to re-launch the player sponsorship scheme with more publicity and excellent benefits. More news to follow soon.

## VOLUNTEERING

Anyone interested in volunteering at Beveree either on matchdays or during the week should <a href='mailto: info@thebeaverstrust.com'>contact us</a> or speak to a Trust or Club representative (usually in hi-vis) at a home match.

## ADVERTISING BOARDS

Boards are available for sale. We are reaching out to prior sponsors but should you or anyone you know be interested please <a href='mailto: info@thebeaverstrust.com'>contact us</a>.

## CLUB Q&A

The recent Q&A with Alan Julian was a good opportunity to hear the manager's thoughts for the upcoming season. It was open to Club members but unfortunately take-up was low. We hope to partner with the Club to organise and publicise future Q&A events as it's an important means of connecting the Club with supporters.

If you do have questions for the club board please <a href='mailto: info@thebeaverstrust.com'>contact us</a> and we will be sure to get a response.

## SURVEY
We want to hear your views on all things Beavers so we have produced a survey to gather data to help improve the Trust and pass on feedback to the Club. There have been so many changes recently that it's time to hear your thoughts to help both us and the Club keep on improving.

Please take the 15 minutes or so to complete the survey. It will be a huge help to the Trust board as we move forward.

No personal details are collected or shared.

Members have been sent this by e-mail but anyone can complete the survey (ideally home fans of course!)

## COACH TRAVEL

We ran several coaches last season, some busier than others, but all were very enjoyable and enabled many fans to attend away games who otherwise couldn't. We intend to do so again this season depending on demand.

Please click below to complete a 2 minute questionnaire to gauge interest on which games you might attend and why.

We will also post social media polls and encourage the Club to help us publicise.

## SOCIAL EVENTS

We will be organising social events this season starting with a quiz night. Look out for details coming soon.

## MEMBERSHIP RENEWAL

If your membership has recently expired you will be receiving a renewal reminder shortly. We continue to improve the website and hope to automate the renewal process soon. Thank you as always for your support.

We have membership cards and badges for every member and will be distributing them soon, hopefully at Beveree. We will let you know the details asap.

## EASYFUNDRAISING

If you haven't heard of it then Easyfundraising is the easiest way to raise funds for the Trust. You simply sign up, and when you shop at all your favourite participating websites a small donation is made from the retailer to the Trust. It's that simple!

Step 1: [Create an account](https://egvwmz.clicks.mlsend.com/tj/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjMzODkwNCxcImxcIjoxMjk4MzEzNDQ1OTYzMjE5NzgsXCJyXCI6MTI5ODMxMzQ1MDE4ODk3NjkzfSIsInMiOiIwY2NlN2ZhNWJhMzBlMjgzIn0)

Step 2: [Add the browser extension](https://egvwmz.clicks.mlsend.com/tj/c/eyJ2Ijoie1wiYVwiOjMzODkwNCxcImxcIjoxMjk4MzEzNDQ2MDE1NjQ4NjEsXCJyXCI6MTI5ODMxMzQ1MDE4ODk3NjkzfSIsInMiOiIxZGIxNDM5MDFjNWU4MWVjIn0) and each time you shop at a participating website you will automatically be asked if you wish to donate. There's also an app.

Step 3: Shop as normal!


Thank you as always for supporting the Beavers Trust and COYB!
