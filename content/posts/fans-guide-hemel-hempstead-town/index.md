# **The Background**
Hemel Hempstead will welcome the Beavers on the back of a change in management. The new manager maybe familiar to you, as ex Beaver boss Alan Dowson now holds the lead role at the Focus Community Arena after departing Dartford earlier in the season. 

# **Travel**
Ground Address – <br>
The Focus Community Arena <br>
Vauxhall Road <br>
Hemel Hempstead <br>
Hertfordshire <br>
HP2 4HW <br>

Nearest **Train** Station is Hemel Hempstead, the stadium is a 45 min walk from the station or a 6-8 min ride in a taxi.
Trains serving Hemel are on the London North Western railway with trains from London Euston, there are currently no planned engineering works that should impact South Western or North Western railway services on this date.

If you are **driving** it will take around an hour dependant on traffic, there is a small car park on site however this does fill up quickly. The stadium is also in a busy residential area so parking near to the ground maybe difficult. If parking in residential roads please do consider residents and park responsibly.

# **Where’s the local?**

The Focus Community Arena is in a large residential area and as such doesn’t benefit from many close by amenities, 

[The Crabtree](https://www.emberinns.co.uk/nationalsearch/eastofengland/the-crabtree-hemel-hempstead/food?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb-menu#/)  – A short walk from the ground

[Windmill Café](https://www.windmillcafe.co.uk/) – Short walk from the ground

[The Plough](https://www.greatbritishinn.co.uk/our-locations/the-plough/) – Short walk from the ground

[Green Man](https://www.opentable.co.uk/r/green-man-hemel-hempstead?ref=4208) – A reasonable walk from the ground

There is a convenience store located on Vauxhall Road a short distance from the ground.  

The Focus Community Arena also has some excellent facilities we recommend out fans support whilst they are there. You will find a well-stocked and welcoming bar and a food outlet just inside the ground.
