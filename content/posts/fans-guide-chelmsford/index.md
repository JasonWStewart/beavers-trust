## Chelmsford City v Hampton & Richmond Borough

Vanarama National League South

Saturday 17th August 2024 – Kick Off 3pm

A trip to Chelmsford City kicks off the Beavers away fixtures in, this, the clubs 9th consecutive season at Step 2. The Clarets and the Beavers have been regular opponents for each other in the 21st Century following Chelmsford’s switch from the Southern League to the Isthmian League and both clubs long stays in the National League South. Last season we also visited Chelmsford on the 2nd Saturday of the season due to ongoing works at Beveree and returned back down the A12 with a point after a 1-1 draw.

## How to Get There

Ground Address – Melbourne Community Stadium, Salerno Way, Chelmsford, CM1 2EH

Road – From Hampton head clockwise round the M25 before leaving at Junction 28 for the A12. At Junction 15 take the A414 signed to Harlow. Continue along the A414 before taking the A1114, A1016 until your turn left in to Corporation Road. Then turn right in to North Avenue, bear left on to Melbourne Avenue and the ground is on the right hand side. 

Parking – There is limited parking at the Melbourne Stadium but you can park on the roads around the ground. Please ensure you park in a way to take account of the neighbours of Chelmsford City.

Public Transport – Trains to Chelmsford depart from London Liverpool Street on a regular basis and take around 50 minutes. You can also catch the train at Stratford. The ground is someway from the station but the C2,C3 and C11 [bus services](https://www.firstbus.co.uk/essex) run close to the ground and take about 15 minutes.

Please be aware that the line out of Liverpool Street is one of the favourite ones for engineering works so check ahead on National Rail Enquiries to make sure trains are running.

## Stadium Information

The Melbourne Stadium is no longer the only stadium with an athletics track following Hornchurch’s promotion last season. However they do have some mobile terracing which goes behind both goals which brings you closer to the pitch and improves the atmosphere. There is a large club house within the ground which has a good selection of drinks plus Sky TV & TNT Sports. There is also a large burger van behind one of the goals.

## Where’s the local?

Chelmsford Town centre has a wealth of pubs and bars in it, however locations near the ground are a little more sparse so visiting Beavers may wish to make use of the bus and taxi to allow time to investigate the options closer to the station. These include

[The Ale House](https://www.the-ale-house-chelmsford.co.uk/)

[Brewhouse](https://www.brewhouseandkitchen.com/venue/chelmsford/)

[The Plough](https://www.theoriginalploughchelmsford.co.uk/#/)

[The Ship](https://theshipchelmsford.co.uk/)

Near the ground there is the [Red Beret](https://www.redberetchelmsford.co.uk/index) which is a 5 minute walk away and, as mentioned above, the club house at the ground is also well worth a visit.
