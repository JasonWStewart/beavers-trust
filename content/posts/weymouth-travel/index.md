The Beavers will travel down to Dorset to face Weymouth in the Vanarama National League South on Tuesday 20th February with a 7.45pm kick off. 

As part of our commitment in helping ensure Beavers fans can follow the team, we are looking at putting on a coach for this trip. To enable us to plan if this is feasible, we would like to ask supporters to sign up to let us know your interest. We are also happy to accomodate one way travel (either direction) however this will be full cost.

If you would like to sign up to let us know your interest in this journey, please let us know
