_______

Your moustachioed Beavers make the trip in to Gloucestershire this weekend to take on Step 4 side Yate Town in what, in football parlance, is a proper banana skin!

Yate have had a flying start to the season and currently sit top of the Southern League Division 1 South Division with a 6 point lead over nearest rivals Exmouth Town. On Wednesday they were held 1-1 at home by Mousehole AFC of Cornwall, now that is an away trip for the hardy! The home side have a squad of players with plenty of Step 2 experience with the likes of Ross Stearn (Bath City, Taunton Town, Weston-super-mare & Chippenham Town), James Taylor (Truro City & Bath City) & Lewis Hall (Taunton Town & Gloucester City) all having regular stints in the National League South. They have not lost at home in the past 10 games.

In the previous round the defeated step 3 Hungerford Town 3-2 with late, late goals from Ollie Dewsbury and Ross Stern earning them a place in the 2nd Round.

Jule’s Beaver boys come in to the game off the back of 3 league wins on the bounce scoring 9 and only conceding 1. Missing will be Ted Curd who in on England duty with the Under 19’s but with George Hunt now back from injury and playing the past 2 games this has provided a boost to the squad. Last time out saw a 4-0 win at Hemel Hempstead with James Roberts picking up a brace, Alfie Williams and Mario Vilhete scoring the others. Roberts is the Beavers leading scorers this season with 8 goals so far.

## How to Get There
By Road – Take the M4 from London and exit at Junction 18 towards Stroud on the A46. After 2 miles turn left on the A432. On entering the Town take the 3rd exit on to Link Road (B4059). Keep on this road and after approximately 2 miles turn right on to North Road.

By Train – Yate is on the Bristol to Gloucester line and has an half hourly service from Bristol Parkway and takes around 8 minutes. To arrive in enough time for a gentle walk up from the station catch the 11.34 from Paddington (12.13 at Reading) which gets to Bristol Parkway at 13.03. The connection time is around 15 minutes and you alight at Yate Station at 13.31. Returning the best connections are at 34 minutes past the hour from Yate.

The ground is within walking distance of Yate Train Station. Alight at the station and go up the stairs before turning right if you have departed a train heading for Bristol or crossing the traffic lights and heading straight across if departing a train going towards Gloucester. You will follow the North Road for 0.6 miles before you reach Iron Acton Way (you will see The Fox pub in front of you). Cross the road at the traffic lights and then make the next left onto Lodge Road where there is a short walk to reach the ground.

## Match Information
On matchdays, the turnstiles will be open at the front of the ground and on some rare occasions where we are expecting record-breaking levels of attendance there will be turnstiles open at the back of the ground.
Car parking is available at The South West Interiors Stadium. For those wishing to find the ground by public transport, local bus services operate to Lodge Road and the surrounding areas, which are again within walking distance of The South West Interiors Stadium.

Tickets are available to purchase on the day with cash and card accepted.

## I’m Hungry and Thirsty!
The ground itself will provide the usual hot and cold food and the bar is open to all supporters.
For those looking to patronise the local establishments there are a couple within walking distance of the ground. The ground itself is in the North-West of the town a fair lick away from the town centre. Of course early risers can get the train all the way to Bristol to sample some of the options there.

Near to the ground, both serving food are the 

Codrington Arms and The Fox.
