## Chertsey Town v Hampton & Richmond Borough

## Saturday 27th July 2024 – Kick Off 3pm

The Beavers finish off their away run of friendlies with a short trip ‘up river’ to Chertsey Town, now of the Southern League Premier South Division, having romped to the Isthmian Division One South Central title last season.

It’s been many years since the Beavers and Curfews met in a league match as both clubs met regularly until the mid 1990’s in the Isthmian League, however there are some strong connections at Chertsey with former manager Mark Harper in the hot seat and ex-Chairman Steve McPherson now Vice-Chairman at Alwyns Lane.

## How to Get There

Ground Address – Alwyns Lane, Chertsey, KT16 9DW

Road – From Hampton head along the Lower Hampton Road, through Lower Sunbury, continue on to the B375 crossing over Chertsey Bridge. Follow Bridge Road until your turn right on to London Street and go through the High Street and Alwyns Lane is on your left hand side. 

Parking – Chertsey have a free parking in a large, 250 space, car park within Alwyns Lane, it is on the left hand side before you reach the ground. If parking in residential roads please be considerate of local residents and make a note of any parking restrictions.

Public Transport – By far the easiest way from Hampton is to jump on the train to Shepperton and then take the 557 which drops you off in Heriot Road and then it is a 5 minute walk to the ground.
