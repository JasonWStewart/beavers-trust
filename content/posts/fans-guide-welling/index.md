**Tuesday 30th January 2024 - Kick off 7.45pm**

**The Background**

Hampton re-connects with an old friend in the Vanarama National League South fixture. Hampton have regularly played the South-East London over the years with 12 meetings since 2016. Hampton currently has the best record winning 7 of those encounters, Welling getting victory in 2 and 3 resulting in draws. Welling is a reasonably simple journey by public transport and there are plenty of places to visit on the way to the ground.
