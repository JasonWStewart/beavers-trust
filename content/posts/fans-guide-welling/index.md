# Travel

## Car

If you are travelling from anywhere other than Kent, take the M25 to Junction 2. At the roundabout, take the A2 towards Central London. Leave the A2 at the third exit (Danson Interchange, signposted A221 to Bexleyheath and Sidcup).

Turn right (second exit) at the roundabout at the end of the slip road, and then turn right (third exit) at the next roundabout. Go under the A2 bridge and up the slope to another roundabout.

Take the second exit and follow the road (Danson Road) to the traffic lights at the end. Turn left at the lights onto Park View Road. The ground is on the left. There is no car park, but plenty of street parking is available. 

## Public Transport

The nearest station is Welling which is on the line to Dartford from both London Victoria and London Charing Cross. For travelling Bevers the easiest route is to catch the train to Waterloo then hop over to Waterloo East where there is a half hourly service. There is also the option to take the underground to North Greenwich and catch the 486 bus.

If you wish to go by bus, numbers 89 (Lewisham to Slade Green), 486 (North Greenwich to Bexleyheath) and B16 (Kidbrooke to Bexleyheath) run past the ground. 

The ground is within the London contactless travel zones (Zone 6).

The ground is around a 25 minute walk from Welling Station.

Meanwhile, two darts boards are available for fans to go head-to-head with their friends.

## Food & Drinks

As usual the ground has a good selection of food and drink, for those looking to sample some local wares Chris Hurst has provided a, fairly comprehensive, review of your options! With many supporters likely to travel straight from work there is no Trust Travel Together location but keep an eye on our socials for updates in the run up to the game! See you there.

From the station make your way along Central Avenue towards Bellegrove Road which becomes Welling High St and leads you to the ground. Along this road there are plenty of pub options. The Plough & Harrow (DA16 3QS) is the first you'll come across. Historically it was a sports bar type pub but its website suggests it's now under new management and states it doesn't want "riff raff" in!

Moving along Bellegrove Road you'll next come to the New Cross Turnpike (DA16 3PB) which is the Wetherspoon pub. Next up, a short walk along the road is the Hangar (DA16 3PB) which is an independent micro-pub serving craft beers. Then there's the Rose & Crown (DA16 1TR) which is another five minute along the road and to your left, this one shows sports on tv.

In recent seasons a popular pre-match 'haunt' has been the Door Hinge, another micro-pub (DA16 1TR) which is probably the best of the lot and is next along the road. It closes at 9pm so will only be available before the match. Claiming to be Greater London's first micro-pub, it serves a wide range of ales and ciders (including takeaway options!) and has an interesting selection of pub games and books. It's traditional pub rules though: no mobile phones!

Finally, the nearest pub to the ground is the Guy Earl of Warwick (DA16 1TB), just outside the stadium entrance, this one is a Greene King pub which serves food and is the place you're most likely to meet home fans. Be aware the walk from station to ground is about a mile so will take a good 25 minutes without the pub stops factored in!
