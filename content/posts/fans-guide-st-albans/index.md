**Saturday 2nd March 2024 - 3pm** <br>
**Vanarama National League South**


# **The Background**

Hampton are on the road to Hertfordshire to pay a visit to fellow play off hopefuls St Albans City in the Vanarama National League South kicking off at 3pm. The Beavers and The Saints have had similar fortunes this season both sitting at the foot of the play off places so everything is set for this to be a great afternoon of football. The reverse of this fixture took place only a few weeks ago and ran out a 0-0 draw at Beveree. The teams have met many times in recent years, 15 times in fact, with honours even. St Albans and Hampton both having 6 wins each and 3 draws between the two sides. 

# **Travel**

Clarence Park Stadium,
Clarence Park,
St Albans,
AL1 4PL

There are several **train** options from Central London to St Albans City (yes, the station is called that!). These services can be picked up from London Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon and St Pancras. A return ticket from one of the Central London stations is around £10.60 for a return. 

To plan your journey we suggest you use the [national rail journey planner](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/journey-planner/).

**There are planned engineering works which will close the lines through Wimbledon all weekend.** This means there are significant changes to the timetable and some trains are not running or are replaced by buses. The Shepperton line, which serves Hampton will be diverted via the Richmond branch so will have a longer journey time and will depart at different times to normal. 

You can check which lines are impacted on South Western Railway [website](https://www.southwesternrailway.com/plan-my-journey/planned-improvements/march-2024-works)

The station is a short walk to the stadium which includes a walk-through Clarence Park, you can see a map below.

From St Albans City rail station head up Station Way (turning left out of the station) at the top of the road turn left on Hatfield Road, crossing over the road and then into Clarence Park through the Hatfield Road Bridge Entrance, it should then be apparent where the ground is, but if you are not sure keep the railway on your left and you will eventually get to the ground. 

If you are **driving**, please be aware there is limited parking around the stadium. There are several car parks in town and at the rail station which maybe best and then take the short walk to the ground.
