# Re-arranged game!

**Tuesday 18th March - 7.45pm** <br>
**Vanarama National League South**


# **Travel**

Clarence Park Stadium,
Clarence Park,
St Albans,
AL1 4PL

There are several **train** options from Central London to St Albans City (yes, the station is called that!). These services can be picked up from London Blackfriars, City Thameslink, Farringdon and St Pancras. A return ticket from one of the Central London stations is around £10.60 for a return. 

To plan your journey we suggest you use the [national rail journey planner](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/journey-planner/).

The station is a short walk to the stadium which includes a walk-through Clarence Park, you can see a map below.

From St Albans City rail station head up Station Way (turning left out of the station) at the top of the road turn left on Hatfield Road, crossing over the road and then into Clarence Park through the Hatfield Road Bridge Entrance, it should then be apparent where the ground is, but if you are not sure keep the railway on your left and you will eventually get to the ground. 

If you are **driving**, please be aware there is limited parking around the stadium. There are several car parks in town and at the rail station which maybe best and then take the short walk to the ground. 

If you are parking at St Albans City train station please be aware that this station doesnt have machines for paying for your parking and it has to be done on the APOCA parking app or by scanning the QR code at the exits. You can find out more about this car park [here](https://www.apcoa.co.uk/parking-in/st-albans-1/st-albans-station-way/).
