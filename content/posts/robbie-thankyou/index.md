We have received a note from Johnathan, Robbie’s brother:

-

Dear All,

I would like to take this opportunity to thank all the supporters and club officials who attended Robert’s funeral and the wake in the clubhouse last Monday.

I think it was a most fitting tribute to my brother, for which I thank you.

Very best wishes

Jonathan

We would also like to extend our thanks to everyone who attended and to those who have expressed their condolences. We would also like to thank Johnathan and Robbie’s family for supporting the trust and to those who could make a donation in Robbie’s memory. 

The photo at the top was provided by Steve Matthews. It shows Robert in happier times, celebrating a cup final win with the Hampton Supporters Club team.
