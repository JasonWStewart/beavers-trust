**The Background**

Hampton make the journey to Dorset midweek to face Weymouth in the Vanarama National League South. The Terras have had mixed fortunes this campaign and currently sit fairly comfortably in mid-table. Since 2019 the Beavers have met Weymouth on 5 occasions Weymouth winning 3, Hampton 2 and no draws between the sides. Earlier this season, back in September Hampton ran out 1-0 winners at Beveree.

Train travel is possible however the last train direct back to London Waterloo departs at 20:07 so this is not an option if you can’t stay overnight. You can check you train travel options [online](https://www.nationalrail.co.uk/).

Weymouth have provided great [travel information](https://uptheterras.co.uk/club-info/directions-to-the-bob-lucas-stadium/)  on their website so we suggest you pay them a visit to look at routes, options and directions.
