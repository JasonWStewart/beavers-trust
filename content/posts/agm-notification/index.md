## Date Set for 2024 AGM

Beavers Trust members received notice today (Tuesday 5th November) of our forthcoming 2024 Annual General Meeting.  It's a busy time of the year as we review our progress, host elections, vote on motions and conduct other business.  At the event there will be important updates from our Chairman and Treasurer, and this year we also hope to have a guest speaker and round table discussion as we plan our activities for the next year - so it's a great time to get involved.

Our AGM will take place on Monday, 25th November 2024 at Beveree (7.15pm start) and is open to all paid up Trust members.  Although the deadline for participation in elections has now passed, you can still become a member and attend the event, so please pencil the date into your diary and join us today.
