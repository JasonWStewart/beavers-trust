# Beavers on the Road
Tuesday 26th November<br>
Chesham United, Vanarama National League South<br>
Kick Off 7.45pm<br>
Venue : The Meadow, Amy Lane, Chesham, HP5 1NE<br>

A Tasking away trip to Buckinghamshire where the Beavers will hope to Master the recently promoted Chesham United at one of the more picturesque grounds in the league.
As your, increasingly, hairy Beavers reach the tail end of November a tough match up awaits with the hosts enjoying a good start to the season as well as an FA Cup run which saw the TV cameras set up at the Meadow in their 1st Round tie against Lincoln City.

Chesham have been knocking on the door of the National League South for several years with only Covid and the play off lottery holding them back. Last year they swept all before them wining the title by 9 points with AFC Totten their nearest rivals. In a real statement of intent they swooped for the prolific Nathan Minhas, an ex-Beaver, after an outstanding season at Slough last year. Mitchell Weiss made the move over from St Albans City following his 14 goals and 12 assists at Clarence Park another former Beaver in Jack Connors is also in the squad.

## How to Get There
By Road – Take J18 off the M25 taking the left lane of the slip road to turn left on to the A404 to Chorleywood/Amersham. You will follow this road through Chorleywood straight through 2 sets of lights. You will then pass a school on your left handside, about 1 mile down the road from there you will see the road bear to the left with a right turn to Chenies and Latimer, take this turn and follow the road in to Chenies, this road will lead you to Chesham, you will see a manor house to your right as you follow the road for about 3 miles. You will eventually find yourself on a one way system at a ‘left turn only’ junction, you will shortly pass an open air pool to your left, follow the road under the bridge, Chesham United is the 2nd exit off the roundabout.

By Train – Chesham is part of the London Underground network and is at the far west of the Metropolitan Line. Walk out of the station and head down Station Road towards the High Street. Turn left and walk through the town until you reach a pedestrian crossing (opposite the Red Lion). Cross the road and bear left by the pub then continue walking until you pass two petrol stations which are opposite each other. At the next roundabout the third exit takes you into Chesham United’s ground. The walk from the station takes 5-10 minutes.

There is a 15 minute service to Chesham and from Waterloo it Jubilee Line to Finchley Road and then it’s a 40 minute journey in to the Buckinghamshire countryside. Another option is to get the Bakerloo Line to Marylebone then Chiltern Railways to Amersham. From there the 1A Bus will take you in to Chesham. The return journey requires catching the 22.10 at Chesham, changing at Wembley Park for Waterloo and sees you set foot back in TW12 at 00.40 on Wednesday morning. It does look like the 22.10 may be the last train out of Chesham so a speedy walk from the ground will be necessary!
