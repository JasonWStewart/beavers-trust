Many Hampton & Richmond Borough supporters will be aware of what is occurring in Devon regarding Torquay United AFC. It goes without saying all of us associated with the Beavers Trust wish Torquay all the very best in resolving these issues and continue to extend the hand of friendship to the [Torquay United Supporters Trust](https://www.tust.co.uk/) who are instrumental in helping secure the future of their club.

Whilst our fixture at Plainmoor is a few weeks away we wanted to let fans know the current news about our visit.
