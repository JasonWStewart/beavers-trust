## The background

The Beavers are currently enjoying a superb run with only 1 defeat in last 17 outings and holding second position in the Vanarama National League South and advancing to the Last 32 in this year’s Isuzu FA Trophy. To continue their journey towards Wembley, Hampton faces a tough challenge in the Fourth Round, away against National League Hartlepool United.

This match marks the first encounter between Hampton & Richmond Borough and Hartlepool United. However, Hampton are no strangers to football in the North after facing a challenging visit to Gateshead in the FA Trophy (old 2nd round) back in 2011, resulting in a 6-0 defeat, a day the Beavers fans would not mind being lost in the history books. With reasonably successful visits to Southend and Yeovil this season the players will not hold too many nerves of running out at one of the bigger stadiums in the National League and will look forward to the boost and noise the Beavers fans can bring. 

## Travel

Due to multiple train travel issues on this day, with major works closing Kings Cross station, a **coach** has been arranged by the Supporters Trust to assist Beavers fans in traveling. Tickets can be booked on the trust’s [online shop](https://hampton-richmond-borough-fc-supporters-society-limit.sumupstore.com/product/hartlepool-coach-travel) and remember that membership of the trust offers a discount on future coach travel, you can purchase membership at the same time! Our official supporters coach will be dropping off supporters near to the away entrance. 

It is possible to **fly** from Heathrow to Newcastle and then travel on the train down from Newcastle to Hartlepool. 

If you have found a way to get to Hartlepool by **train** you will find the ground about half a mile by foot. Walk out of the station to the main road (Church Street) and turn right. Follow the road and the floodlights come into view. Cross the main A179 and bear right into Clarence Road to the ground.

If you are **driving**, it is suggested to use the sat nav postcode TS24 8BZ. Parking at the ground is limited, but you may be able to book a space by giving them a call on 01429272584. Otherwise, you can park locally but please be considerate of our hosts neighbours. 

If you fancy making a weekend of it there are various hotels however the [Premier Inn](https://www.premierinn.com/gb/en/hotels/england/county-durham/hartlepool/hartlepool-marina.html) and [Travelodge](https://www.travelodge.co.uk/hotels/570/Hartlepool-Marina-hotel) located a short walk from the ground in the town centre have reasonable prices. 

## Admission and stadium information

Admission prices to the Suits Direct Stadium range from free for under 5’s to the reduced rate of £12 for adults, thanks to Hartlepool for this generous price reduction for our fixture. Tickets can be purchased online from [Hartlepool United](https://www.hartlepoolunited.co.uk/tickets/guide-for-away-fans/). For those unable to purchase online, the club's ticket office will be open from 10 am on match-day for on-the-day purchases.

## Where’s the local?

Whichever way you are traveling to support the Beavers the ground is very close to the town so, if you have the time, it’s well worth a look around, there are plenty of places for a pre-match drink and some food. Below are some key locations we have found with a link to their website for you to check out what they have to offer (this is not a recommendations list). 

[The Ward Jackson JD Weatherspoon’s pub](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/all-pubs/england/county-durham/the-ward-jackson-hartlepool) – Church Street

[The King Johns Tavern](https://www.teesinns.co.uk/king-johns-tavern/) – South Road

[Jacksons Wharf](https://www.jacksonswharfpub.co.uk/) - The Highlight

The Clarendon – Tower Street

[Rat Race Ale House](http://www.ratracealehouse.co.uk/) – Located at the station (not open before match)

**Please note some pubs may have a home supporter only policy, please check on arrival**

From Hartlepool’s website “away fans are welcome to enjoy a pre-match drink in The Centenary Suite located on Clarence Road.” 

There is also an ASDA, Morrisons and M&S Simply Food directly outside the stadium. You will also find a McDonalds the other side of the ASDA superstore as well as various food outlets within the town.
  
Once in the ground, the club offers catering in the away end with a selection of hot and cold drinks and we have been told you should try their famous foot-long hotdogs!

Additionally, there is a bar facility in the away end, which we believe will be open to our supporters before and after the match. Please note all of these facilities are card payment only. 

**This trip promises to be another memorable away day for the Beavers, and we look forward to experiencing Hartlepool’s hospitality and the chance to witness the Beavers in action. We hope to see and hear you there.**
