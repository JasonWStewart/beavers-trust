The Trust is pleased to announce the successful adoption of the latest 2022 version of the FSA Rules template for supporters' societies. Following extensive consultation with the Football Supporters Association (FSA), the Trust Board proposed the adoption, and the motion was accepted, marking a significant milestone in the Trust's commitment to transparent and accountable governance.

The Trust Board extends its gratitude to the FSA for their invaluable guidance during the consultation process, which has resulted in the seamless integration of updated governance documentation. The newly adopted Rules will be made available to members, reflecting the Trust's dedication to open communication and member engagement.
