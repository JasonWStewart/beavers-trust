The Beavers fans turned up in good numbers and voice for our FA Trophy 4th Round match, thank you to everyone of the 94 who travelled by coach, took flights, trains or drove to cheer on Mel and team to victory in Hartlepool.

The feedback we have had from supporters and the coach company was extremely positive and we look forward to working with [Imperial Coaches](https://imperialcoaches.co.uk/) to deliver travel for our fans to more away fixtures. 

We are looking at running coaches to a selection of remaining fixtures, although please note these are still to be confirmed:

- **Weymouth** (Tuesday 20th Feb) Depending on demand
- **Torquay United** (Saturday 23rd March)
- **Worthing** (Monday 1st April)
- **Maidstone** (Saturday 20th April)


Please let a member of the trust board know if you would be interested in joining us for these trips so we have a good idea how many people may want to travel. Once confirmed you will be able to book your place online. If you have any suggestions for coach travel please see any of our trust [board memebers](https://thebeaverstrust.com/board/) or you can e-mail us, beaverstrust@gmail.com. Keep an eye on our website and socials for coach booking information. 

With regards the FA Trophy Hampton have progressed through thanks to another penalty shoot-out win against a team from the division above. The draw for the next round has been made and Hampton will host [Macclesfield](https://macclesfieldfc.com/) of the Northern Premier League in the [5th round](https://www.thefa.com/news/2024/jan/15/isuzu-fa-trophy-fa-vase-draws-details-20241501). Macclesfield have a significant support for step 3 so it will be a busy day at Beveree and we look forward to seeing as many fans as possible there for what is now our best ever FA Trophy run.
