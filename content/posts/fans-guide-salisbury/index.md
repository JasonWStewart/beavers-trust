## The Match
The Beavers recent poor form continued with a disappointing 1-0 defeat at Enfield Town making it just the one win in the past 8 games. Although comfortably ahead of the relegation battle Alan Julian has said he doesn’t want his players coasting to the end of the season and expects to see an improvement in results. 
Salisbury currently sit in 19th place 5 points above the bottom 4 though both St Albans and Welling have a game in hand on them. With Aveley and Weymouth looking doomed it does appear to be two from four with Enfield Town also on 38 points.
Salisbury’s midweek game saw them pick up a very good point in a 2-2 draw at Torquay United, but that was only their second point in 6 games as they sit one place below Hampton in the form guide. In the match earlier this season at Beveree a late Alex Wall goal secured a home win for the Beavers in front of a crowd of 608. With both teams desperately out of form something must give, surely?

## Directions (taken from Salisbury FC website)
Salisbury FC’s The Raymond McEnhill Stadium is located 3 miles outside the city centre in Old Sarum. It is accessible via a 40-minute walk from the town centre, or via a short bus journey. Salisbury Reds’ PR11 travels between the city centre and will drop you off next to the stadium. Alternatively, the X4, X5, and Activ8 buses go between Blue Boar Row and the Beehive Roundabout, which is a 15-minute walk from the Ray Mac. For further information on buses, please follow the below links:

- [PR11](https://www.salisburyreds.co.uk/services/SWWD/PR11)
- [X4](https://www.salisburyreds.co.uk/services/SWWD/X4)
- [X5](https://www.salisburyreds.co.uk/services/SWWD/X5)
- [Activ8](https://www.salisburyreds.co.uk/services/SWWD/8)

If travelling by car, take the first exit on the Beehive Roundabout after the Park & Ride. Take the second exit at the next roundabout and then turn left onto Partridge Way after the crossroads. The Raymond McEnhill Stadium is located at the end of the street. Please do not park in the housing estate or on Partridge Way.
If driving from Hampton take the M3 and exit at Junction 8 for the A303. Take the exit signed Salisbury A338 after around 20 miles and follow the A338 until you reach the Portway Roundabout, take the 2nd exit and the entrance to Partridge Way is on the right hand side after a couple of miles.
For those looking to take public transport Salisbury is easy to get to as it is only around 80 minutes on the train from Clapham Junction. Prices on a group save are around £33 per adult if booking in groups of 3 or more. You can purchase tickets direct from South Western Railways [HERE](https://www.southwesternrailway.com/buy-train-tickets/ticket-search-results?openQTT=1).

There is a half hourly service leaving Clapham at 27 and 57 minutes past the hour. Allowing for Bus connections the latest train that you could get to arrive in time would be the 12.27 out of Clapham. Direct return journey times are at 17.21,18.21 and 19.26. There is also a service at 17.47 and 18.47 which require a change at Basingstoke

## Culture!
Right so we all know about [Stonehenge](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/stonehenge/?utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=stonehenge&utm_source=Google%20Business&utm_campaign=Local%20Listings&utm_medium=Google%20Business%20Profiles&utm_content=stonehenge) yes? Situated some 6 miles from Salisbury there is a regular bus service from the City Centre to take you to the UNESCO World Heritage site. 

However it’s not all Henge’s in Salisbury you know! There is plenty of other cultural and historic options to explore.
Close to the ground is the [Iron Age](https://www.english-heritage.org.uk/visit/places/old-sarum/) Fort of Old Sarum with both sites run by English Heritage so you could knock off both on the day. For those with an interest in aviation, and again close to the ground, the [Boscombe Down Aviation Collection](http://boscombedownaviationcollection.co.uk/) is open from 10am on Saturday.

In the City there is the [Cathedral](https://www.salisburycathedral.org.uk/), popular with Russian spies, and home of the Magna Carta as well as [Salisbury Museum](https://salisburymuseum.org.uk/) close by. Also within the Cathedral site there is [Mompesson House](https://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/visit/wiltshire/mompesson-house) which is run by the National Trust.

## Pubs!
Where to start? So many choices!
Well, I’ll start with options close to the ground. Basically, few and far between though the [Dark Revolution Brewery](https://www.darkrevolution.co.uk/) is close to the ground and opens at midday on Saturday. [The Winterborne Arms](https://www.winterbournearmspub.co.uk/) is on the A338 shortly after the Portway Roundabout. To the South of the ground near [Old Sarum](https://www.harvester.co.uk/restaurants/southwest/theoldcastlesalisbury?utm_source=google&utm_medium=organic&utm_campaign=gmb-homepage#/) is a Harvester for those who want something to eat.

Now for the City Centre and you really have so many options! 

Around the marketplace there is [The Ox Row](https://www.theoxrowinn.co.uk/) Inn and [The Haunch of Venison](http://haunchpub.co.uk/) both worth a visit. On the Riverside as you come in to town you have Green Kings’s [The Bishop’s Mill](https://www.greeneking.co.uk/pubs/wiltshire/bishops-mill), Stonegate’s [The Bridge Tap](https://www.socialpubandkitchen.co.uk/bridge-tap-salisbury) and a Wetherspoons in the form of [The Kings Head Inn](https://www.jdwetherspoon.com/pubs/the-kings-head-inn-salisbury). Whilst near the Cathedral there is[ The Chapter House](https://www.thechapterhouseuk.com/), [The Wig and Quill](https://www.thewigandquill.com/), [The New Inn](https://thenewinnsalisbury.co.uk/) and a [Cosy Club](https://cosyclub.co.uk/location/salisbury/). To the North of the marketplace there is [The Pheasant Inn](https://www.thepheasantpubsalisbury.com/) as well as [The Coach & Horses](https://coachandhorsessalisbury.co.uk/).

For those looking for a meal there are loads of chain and independent restaurants in the city centre to choose from. Basically, if you come out of Salisbury hungry and thirsty you haven’t been trying!

See you all there and get behind the Beavers on Saturday!
