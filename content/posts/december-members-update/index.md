Your newly elected Beavers Trust board held its first meeting yesterday evening (11th December 2023), and this brief update is being issued to members as part of our commitment to improving communication and transparency. All 10 directors were present at the meeting, which was held at the Hampton Hub.

The following positions/roles were agreed unanimously:

- **Chairman:** Stefan Rance
- **Vice Chairman:** Matt Williams
- **Secretary:** Chris Hurst
- **Treasurer:** Curt Higgins
- **Media:** Ben Harrison-Hyde
- **Membership Secretary:** Dave Rees

Handover meetings will be arranged between the outgoing Treasurer, John Ormerod, and Curt Higgins; and between the outgoing Secretary, Alistair Bruce, and Chris Hurst. There was a lot of administration to cover as the previous boardâ€™s minutes were read and accepted, and documents, including the newly adopted FSA Model rules, were discussed. Phil Weller and Iain MacKinnon, who are the only two directors remaining from the previous board, helped to onboard and update the eight newly elected directors on various items.

Membership of the Trust stood at 159 at the previous AGM, with one new member signed up since then. It was agreed by the new board that meetings should be held on a monthly basis, with the next one scheduled for early January 2024. Many exciting plans were discussed, including a new Trust website, growing the membership, and future fan engagement, and the new board will update members with progress as we go. Thanks to all members who participated in the recent Trust AGM and board elections.
