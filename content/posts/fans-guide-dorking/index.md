# If Carlsberg did ownership changes…..

After a historic week at Beveree which saw a change in ownership at the very top Alan Julien’s side ensured happy faces all round with a thumping 5-0 win against Welling United at Beveree on Saturday. Two up inside five minutes quashed the nerves, and a rampant home side ensured fans were able to enjoy their afternoon in the sun and retain our place in the National League South for another season. To say the atmosphere at Beveree was jumping was a understatement and everyone at the club has a renewed sense of optimism and belief.

Good Friday sees a short into the Surrey Hills to the picturesque town of Dorking to face on of the 5 teams who can still, realistically, lay claim to be in the running to go up as League Champions. With leaders Truro entertaining Torquay and 2nd place Worthing travelling to 3rd place Eastbourne points will be dropped somewhere so Marc White’s side will be looking to take advantage.

Having dropped down from Step 1 last year Dorking have made good on their desire to reclaim their place at the earliest opportunity. The squad is filled with experience and strength in depth with the likes of Bobby-Joe Taylor, Tony Craig, Matt Briggs, Josh Taylor, Alfie Rutherford and the, always dangerous, Jason Prior forming the spine of the team.

For the Beavers there was the welcome return to the starting line up of James Roberts against Welling and Jake Gray getting more minutes from the bench. Harry Gardner will be looking to continue his good form following his hat-trick and Archie Taylor will be available for this game despite is red card on Saturday as the suspension kicks in 1 week after the initial card.

It will be another tough game against a very good side, but Dorking is nice and easy to get to, has a fine selection of establishments (more on that later) so hopefully we will see as many Beaver fans making the trip down on Good Friday.
