## Bath City v Hampton & Richmond Borough

Vanarama National League South

Monday 26th August 2024 – Kick Off 3pm


After what feels like an eternity, the fixture computer has finally gifted Hampton a 3pm away trip to Bath City. A UNESCO World Heritage City, a trip to Bath is one of the highlights in the National League South calendar and a wonderful place to spend a Bank Holiday Monday. To go with it, Twerton Park is a gem of a stadium and one of the few remaining ‘old school’ grounds still in use so for those making the trip for the first time, you’re in for a treat. But, of course, you’ve got to get there first…

## Getting to Bath

Address – Twerton Park, 105 High St, Twerton, Bath, BA2 1DB

Bath is a city on the ‘M4’ corridor, and this represents the quickest route from South West London this part of the South West. If taking this route, exit at junction 18 and take the A46 following signs to Bath. At the London Road roundabout, take the third exit and this road will take you into the city. If you are planning to drive straight to the ground, it may be quicker to turn right off the A46 onto Gorse Lane and cross over the A420 to Freezinghill Lane as this leads to the side of the city closer to Twerton Park.

There is also the scenic route, which takes slightly longer but does go past Stonehenge, if you wish to take it. For this you will need to take the M3 to the A303, and continue until the junction with the A36 (following signs for Warminster/Frome/Westbury). This will take you straight to Bath, and to Twerton Park as well if you keep going

For those going on public transport, you can take the train directly from London Paddington (1h 20m) or Reading (50m) to Bath Spa station.

## Getting to Twerton Park from the City

Twerton Park is not particularly close to the centre of Bath; it would take over 40 minutes to walk from the Abbey to the ground. Therefore, it is useful to know how to get out to Twerton. You can make the walk shorter by taking a train from Bath Spa to Oldfield Park, from which the stadium is 20 minutes away. Alternatively, you can pick up the 5 or U5 buses from stops at Bath Spa station and James Street West (which is conveniently next to the Bath Brew House). If on the 5, get off at Twerton Parade. If on the U5, get off at Twerton Bridge.

## The Stadium

I would argue Twerton Park is the best stadium in the league (outside of TW12 obviously). It’s looming floodlights can be seen way before getting close to the scent of the burger van and it’s terracing is reminiscent of a time football seems increasingly like it wants to forget. One long-side is dominated by a stunning slopping stand, while the other has a family seating area next to a charming, seated stand, and a burger stand alongside it. 

The main bar is Charlie’s, which is outside of the ground serving a very reasonable selection of lagers, ales, and, of course, cider. In what might be a new development for some returning visitors, there is now a bar inside the ground as well in the corner opposite the seated stand at the ‘Bath End’ (there isn’t anything on draught from here). Bear in mind that you are limited to standing behind the goal at the Bath End or the halfway line on the ‘sloped’ side if you buy a drink from here.

## Where’s The Local?

Good question, and depends on your definition of local given the distance between Bath’s city centre and Twerton. In the city, you are spoiled for choice when it comes to good pubs. [Lamb and Lion](https://www.greatukpubs.co.uk/lamb-and-lion-bath) is an excellent sports pub, with a nice ambience, decent size garden, good food, and loads of TVs. [Bath Brew House](https://www.thebathbrewhouse.com/) is also a quality establishment with an unrivalled selection in Bath, and regularly has great guest brews. The Irish pub, [Flan O’Briens](https://www.flanobrien.com/), on Kingsmead Square is also brilliant. Closer to the ground, I would recommend either [The Royal Oak](http://www.theroyaloakbath.co.uk/) or The [Golden Fleece](https://www.great-british-pubs.co.uk/locations/south-west-england/somerset/bath/golden-fleece-twerton).

If you are planning to stay beyond the final whistle and find yourself somewhat peckish, I’ll quickly recommend a few places to eat in Bath.

- Pizza – [The Oven](https://www.theovenpizzeria.co.uk/)
- Burgers – [Schwartz Bros](https://www.schwartzbros.co.uk/)
- Thai – [Salathai](https://www.salathai-bath.co.uk/)
- Indian – [Mantra](https://mantraofbath.co.uk/)
- Pub Grub – [Lamb & Lion](https://www.greatukpubs.co.uk/lamb-and-lion-bath)

Whatever you choose to do with your day, you’re almost certain to have a good time, regardless of the result at 5pm.
