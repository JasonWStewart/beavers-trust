**Hornchurch v Hampton & Richmond Borough**

**Saturday 30th November 2024 – Kick off 3pm**

Your Beavers make the trip to Essex this weekend to take on newly promoted Hornchurch as we continue our Vanarama National League South campaign.  This will be our first reverse fixture of the season as we’ve hosted them at home already – on the opening day of the season – all the details you need for this weekend are below.

Founded: 1923 <br>
Nickname: The Urchins<br>
Stadium: Hornchurch Stadium<br>
Capacity: 3,500 (800 seated)<br>
Last result vs Hampton: 1-3 (Hornchurch win)

## Recap
Our last home game against Aveley saw an outstanding 2-0 win for the Beavers; impressive second half goals from two of our defensive players secured the victory for Hampton. First, Kristian Campbell steered the ball past two defenders and drove it from the edge of the area into the top right corner, clipping the post on the way in (53’), then Mike Atkinson doubled the lead with an audacious effort from outside the area (74’), it’s worth watching the highlights for this strike alone!

At Chesham on Tuesday night Hampton were dominating throughout the first 45 minutes however Chesham took the lead with a goal from Brad Clayton (33’). Only two minutes later, T’Sharne Gallimore was cautioned with a yellow card after a foul on Mauro Vilhete. Just five minutes into the second half, Gallimore got his second yellow. Despite being up against ten men for much of the second half, Hampton failed to find a way through a packed Chesham defence. Credit to Chesham who reorganised after the sending off early in the second half. James Roberts slotted away a penalty for Hampton (55’), sending the keeper the wrong way, but with just over 20 minutes left, former Hampton player Nathan Minhas secured Chesham’s 2-1 win over the Beavers.

## Form Guide
Both Hampton and Hornchurch have won four out of their last five league games, each losing one.  Hampton were on a short run of consecutive wins however that unfortunately ended on Tuesday night; meanwhile Hornchurch won 2-1 away at Enfield Town.

## Travel
For those on public transport, we recommend meeting at the Munich Cricket Club next to London Fenchurch Street Station from 12pm onwards; we will then aim for the 1:30pm train out of Fenchurch Street which should have us in the ground not long after 2pm.  If you are planning to drive, it is round the M25 clockwise and exit from Junction 29 then take the A127 towards Gallows Corner, following signs for Upminster.  For your Satnav its Bridge Avenue, RM14 2LX.

## Where’s the Local?
Hornchurch is not known for its pubs, however if you are alighting the District Line at Upminster Bridge (the closest station to the ground) the obvious pre-match choice is the [Windmill](https://www.greeneking.co.uk/pubs/essex/windmill), which is a sizable Greene King pub serving usual pub food although the beer choice is fairly limited. It opens from 11:30am on Saturdays and is a five-minute walk from the ground.

For those seeking more beer culture locally you could stay on the District Line for one extra stop and alight at Upminster Station itself, where you can find within a few minutes walk of the station both the [Upminster Taproom](https://www.facebook.com/upminstertaproom/?locale=en_GB) and the [Brewdog Upminster](https://drink.brewdog.com/uk/upminster); plenty of local, unusual and new beers to try there. If you’re planning on doing this, it’s easier to hop back on the District Line one stop to Upminster Bridge for the football when you’ve had enough drink!

There is nowhere of any note for eating so we advise you to either bring a packed lunch or grab some grub at the ground. For local restaurants or cafes, you would need to get off the train at Hornchurch (the stop before Upminster Bridge) and wonder into Hornchurch itself.

## Fun Facts
We once beat Hornchurch on penalties in the FA Cup, this was during our 2020/21 campaign. After an eventful 2-2 draw in front of an empty Beveree (Covid lockdown) the Beavers won 4-3 in the shootout.  Our penalty scorers that day were Niko Muir, Charlie Wassmer, Jake Gray and Ryan Hill.  The only players from Hampton’s squad that day who are with us are Jake Gray and of course Alan Julian, who was in goal.

## Historical Meetings
We have an impressive record against the Urchins.  We’ve played them a total of 28 times. Hampton have won 17, drawn five and lost just six.  We have scored 48 goals against them.

Safe travels and we hope to see as many of you as possible at the Munich Cricket Club en route!
