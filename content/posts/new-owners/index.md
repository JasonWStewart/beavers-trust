# THE BEAVERS TRUST BOARD STATEMENT


9th April 2025

The Beavers Trust are delighted to welcome the clubâ€™s new owners.

The Trust Board is looking forwards to working with the club and owners to support the team and the club in whatever way we and our members can.

This is a fresh start and a new chapter in the over 100 year history of our club, which we believe all supporters and members can look forward to.

Up the Beavers!!
