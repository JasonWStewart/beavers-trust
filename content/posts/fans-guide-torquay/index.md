# Overview
We’re firmly into the second half of the season now and Alan Julian’s men are asking questions of the playoff hopefuls above them as we prepare to visit Devon to take on promotion chasers Torquay United.   January has brought significant change at Hampton.  Loanees Ted Curd and Jack Taylor were recalled by Chelsea and Sutton United respectively; Charles Hagan moved on; Odei Martin Sorondo re-joined Worthing; and the injury-stricken Gio Crichlow left the club.  In their place goalkeeper Max Merrick arrived (another loanee from Chelsea who has represented England at Under 20 level and secured a clean sheet on his debut at the weekend); defender Lachlan Byrd joined on loan from Aldershot Town (although the in-form Jerry Wiltshire has been given the nod ahead of him at centre-back thus far); and forward Makise Evans also signed to complete a busy month for Alan Julian.  James Roberts will be available for selection once again, having completed his three-match suspension. 

# Form Guide
Writing these notes before Tuesday night’s fixture against high-flying Boreham Wood, Hampton have secured six points from their last two games, a steady performance against Tonbridge at the weekend brought a comfortable 2-0 win; and a lively midweek fixture at Welling the previous Tuesday saw Hampton turn the score around to leave Park View Road as 3-2 winners.  In the last five, it’s a more balanced picture as the Beavers have won two, drawn two and lost one.  Our opponents meanwhile will be disappointed to have been held to a draw by lowly St Albans City at the weekend, Jordan Young cancelled out an early opener for the Saints but Torquay were unable to find a winner. Torquay’s form is similar to ours, they also boast two wins, two draws and a loss from their last five, the loss being a humbling 5-1 defeat at Worthing. Nevertheless, they were the first side to break the 50-point barrier, with 51 from 26 games, and they top the table going into their midweek fixture against Slough Town.

# Fan Travel
There’s no supporters coach for this one, so trains are the recommended mode of transport on Saturday.  The 09:03 train out of London Paddington, arriving into Torquay at 11:49, is the train of choice for several Hampton supporters.  On the way back the 18:20 out of Torquay looks to be the best option, so feel free to join us.  If you are driving, please respond to our recent social media post requesting anyone who can offer a lift to come forward, as we have some supporters in search of a car-share.  If you’re driving, be advised there is no dedicated parking at Plainmoor, and fans are advised to arrive early and find street parking in the numerous roads located around the stadium.

# Stadium
Torquay’s impressive Plainmoor is a ‘proper’ football league ground.  Away supporters will be housed in Block A of the Bristow’s Bench Stand (an all-seater which runs the length of the pitch, with Block A being tucked away behind one of the corners). There’s a great view from up there (see photo) but you won’t be able to stand behind the goal or switch ends at half time.  Turnstiles 9, 10 and 11 are the designated away turnstiles.

Supporters should be aware that in recent seasons there has been no access to outside smoking areas at half time; and stewards at Torquay are among the most ‘robust’ in the league, they take a dim view of anyone standing in the aisles or taking photographs inside the ground, take note!  

While there is no access to the bar once you have entered the ground, a food outlet is available for away supporters offering the usual burger/chips type options, it’s not gourmet but it does the job. It usually closes quite early in the second half so get your lunch order in before then.  The Boots & Laces Bar is located just outside the ground, behind the goal on the south side (Westlands Lane) which is also where the ticket office is situated. While the Boots & Laces Bar is frequented by home supporters it’s still very welcoming for away fans too and a visit is recommended – Torquay fans are a friendly bunch.

# Tickets
Match tickets are priced at £20 (adults), £18 (over 65s and students), £11 (under 18s) and £8 (under 8s) and you can purchase yours online at the link above and below this article, just make sure you select Bristow’s Bench Block A to be seated among the Hampton support. All matchday tickets will be fulfilled as e-tickets, with all turnstiles at Plainmoor now cashless.  Torquay United advise that tickets should be purchased online in advance of the fixture.  You can purchase from the ticket office over the phone if you prefer, on 01803 328 666, between 9.30am and 4.30pm Monday-Friday.

# Pubs / Pre-Match
Plainmoor is located to the north of the town, about a 10-minute walk from the Babbacombe district.  If you want to ‘play it safe’ and stay close to the ground prior to kick-off, there are two pub options in Babbacombe.  The Divers Arms (Babbacombe Downs Rd, TQ1 3L) is the first but perhaps the better option is the Babbacombe Inn round the corner (Babbacombe Downs Rd, TQ1 3LP), this place has sea views, does breakfast from 9am, is spacious and family-friendly.  Both are approximately a 10-minute walk from the ground… but it would be a shame not to visit the town centre itself, have a stroll on the beach and take in the views, wouldn’t it?  

If you’re heading to the centre of town, the best option for pubs is to head for the inner harbour (where Victoria Parade meets Torwood St).  In this area you’ll find a good smattering of different types of pubs to suit all tastes, including the Green Ginger (Wetherspoon); the Devon Arms (free house offering local ales and pub grub); the Clock Tower (Craft Union bar showing sports); and the Hole in the Wall (classic 16th century pub with exposed beams) all within short walking distance of each other. Please be aware that in this area you are a good 30-minute walk from the ground and the walk is mostly uphill.  Taxis can be unreliable so make sure you plan ahead, pre-book a taxi or set off on your walk in good time for kick-off.  Torbay Taxis is the company recommended on Torquay’s official website - 01803 211 611.  Alternatively, bus service 35A can be picked up from Torquay Harbourside and will bring you to the shops in Plainmoor.  The Bristow’s Bench Block A is a five-minute walk from the shops.

# Fun Facts
Hampton first visited Plainmoor over the Bank Holiday weekend in August 2018, with Torquay United unexpectedly gracing National League South following relegation.  Gary McCann’s Hampton side emerged 2-0 winners that sunny day, the goals being scored by Rhys Murrell-Williamson and Chris Dickson.  

The signage outside the Boots & Laces Bar which welcomed Hampton supporters after a long journey (see picture) inspired the Supporters Trust to begin writing a similar message to visiting away fans on a chalk board of our own and display it on the Supporters Trust table in the ground before home fixtures at Beveree.  It is also the inspiration behind the messaging to away supporters on the back page of our 2024/25 matchday programmes.  This will be our eighth meeting with the Gulls, in the previous seven Hampton have won twice, drawn once and lost on four occasions.  One of those losses was an FA Cup 4th Qualifying Round replay (Hampton really should have won the first leg at Plainmoor!).  The Gulls went on to play Derby County in the 1st Round Proper, what a payday that would have been.  Anyway, onwards and upwards, safe travels and see you on the English Riviera!
