Nearest **Train** Station is Torre which is around a 25-minute walk to Plainmoor. Or you could book a taxi, if you want to do this we would suggest doing so before the day as Taxi services can be very busy in and around Torquay. This station is served by Great Western Railway on the Newton Abbot to Paignton line, so would mean a change of train at Newton Abbot from the London Paddington line. Or you could go to Torquay station and taxi from there.

If you are travelling by **car** The South Devon Link Road runs from Newton Abbot to Torquay, and allows quick access for home and away fans. We do not have any dedicated parking at Plainmoor, and therefore advise fans to get to Plainmoor early so that they can find street parking in the numerous roads located around the stadium.

**Bus** service 35A can be picked up from Torquay Harbourside and will bring you to the shops in Plainmoor. The ground is then around a 5-minute walk from the shops.

## Where’s the local?
Plainmoor is located in a residential area of Torquay and there are not a huge number of pubs or places to go nearby. However Babbacombe bay is a short walk where you will find a handful of nice pubs or you can head down into the town and seafront where there are many venues to enjoy some drinks and food.
