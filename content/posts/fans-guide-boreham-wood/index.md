Tuesday 21st January, Kick Off 7.45pm (Re-arranged Match!)

Mangata Pay UK Stadium, Meadow Park, Broughinge Road, Borehamwood, Herts, WD6 5AL

It’s been a fair few years since the Beavers made the trip to the home of EastEnders to face Boreham Wood. During the Isthmian and early National League South days the two clubs were regular opponents but following our relegation from the NLS at the end of the 2011/12 season the clubs have only this season’s encounter at Beveree over the past 12 years. That game finished 1-1 with Jake Gray giving the Beavers the lead before Kwesi Appiah scored a 94th minute equaliser to ensure a share of the spoils.

Following promotion in 2015 the Wood had cemented themselves as a solid National League club with 3 appearances in the playoffs and a highest finish of 4th in 2017/18. It was, therefore, somewhat of a surprise to see them relegated at the end of last season. After a slow start to the season they reunited with Luke Garrad, the man behind their successes over the past seasons, and this has seen an uptick in form and they now sit 2nd just one point behind Torquay. Their recent form has them picking up 16 points from the past 18 as they look for a quick return to Step 1.

For Hampton this provides an opportunity to bounce back from last Saturday’s defeat at home to Spennymoor Town in the FA Trophy. With Jack Taylor recalled by Sutton United there are opportunities at the heart of defence for some of those squad players to step up and grab that starting position. The Beavers currently sit in 10th place in the form guide with just the 1 defeat in the last 6 games but, similarly, with only one win. Overall Alan Julien’s side currently sit in 12th place in the league 11 points of the last play off spot and 14 points ahead of the final relegation place.

For your travelling Beaver hoard Boreham Wood is one of the easier games to get to this season, travelling by Road you can either use the M25 and exit and Junction 21 on to the Southern M1 or take the North Circular to Brent Cross before turning North on the A1. 

Again, train transport gives you plenty of options, Boreham Wood is served on the same line as St Albans so you can catch trains from Kings Cross / St Pancreas, or go via the Overground line from Richmond to West Hampstead and pick up a train there. The ground is approximately a 20 minute walk from the train station.

# Food & Drink
The ground has catering facilities in the away area but there is no access to the club house for away fans and Boreham Wood recommend using local pubs and restaurants in the local area.

On route from the train station to the ground you do have a selection of pubs, restaurants and fast food options available. As well as big chains such as Nando’s and McDonalds you can wet your whistle at this selection of pubs.

# Beavers Trust Travel Together 
At most away trips the Trust will look to offer supporters the chance to travel together to help introduce new fans to each other and to build support for these games. For this Saturday the meeting point is The Barrel Vault in St Pancreas Station with an 11am meet. All are welcome, young or old, new or longstanding, Trust Member or not, to join with us as we head up the line in search of another 3 points for Jule’s boys.
If you want to join us during the day at another point then just get in contact via any of our socials and one of the board will let you know where you can find us.

## Segregation
All National League South fixtures at the Mangata Pay UK Stadium Meadow Park will operate under full segregation.

## Visiting supporters
Visiting supporters to the Mangata Pay UK Stadium Meadow Park will be located at the South End of the ground, accessible via turnstiles 9 & 10, where there is an allocation for up to 1,250 spectators; this allocation is made up on 359 covered seats in our West Stand (operating on a first come first serve basis), whilst the remainder is made up of uncovered standing along the South and South East terraces.

Please note: It may be necessary to amend the location/configuration of visiting supporter’s allocation within the Stadium from time-to-time during the season to meet police and/or other operational requirements, however in these circumstances your club will be advised of any changes accordingly ahead of your fixture at the Mangata Pay UK Stadium Meadow Park.
Visiting supporter toilet facilities are located in the South West corner of the Stadium, whilst catering/refreshments are available from the middle of our South terrace via our Stadium catering partners.

## Car parking & club house usage
Limited supporter parking is available at the Mangata Pay UK Stadium Meadow Park with the club car park prioritised for players, directors, officials and guests.
We advise supporters coming to the Stadium to park in Brook Road Public Car Park. Access to the Stadium is available from this car park via the South Stand Turnstiles (turnstiles 9 & 10 for visiting supporters) or via a public footpath through the adjacent park (turnstiles 1 to 6 for home supporters.) Please note that parking charges may apply.

Alternative parking is also available via the Hertsmere Council Civic Car Park, which is less than a 5-minute walk to ground. Again, please note parking charges may apply.

Unfortunately, due to our segregation policy and with the club house being located in the home section of the Stadium, our club house is for home supporters only on match days. Visiting supporters are advised to use the facilities in the town centre just a short walk away from the Stadium.
