**Maidstone United v Hampton & Richmond Borough**

**Saturday 20th April 2024 – Kick off 3pm**

# The Background
It all comes down to the last match with Hamptons play off fate in our own hands. Three points will guarantee a 6th or 7th place finish, anything else then we rely on other results! 

The team need our support on Saturday against a Maidstone team that will be fighting hard for the highest possible finish to avoid the play off eliminators, get along and support the team in our last league fixture of the season. 

# Travel
Ground Address - Gallagher Stadium, James Whatman Way, Maidstone, ME14 1LQ

There are two mainline **train** stations within walking distance of the Gallagher Stadium. Maidstone East is on the London/Ashford International line (London Charing Cross and Victoria) and Maidstone Barracks is on the Medway Valley Line.

There is also a group of supporters planning to travel on the 12.34 departure from Waterloo East (arrives Maidstone 13.32) so if you are going on the train meet up with other fans and enjoy the day together!
