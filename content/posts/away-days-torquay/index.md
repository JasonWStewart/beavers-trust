The Beavers Trust coach travelled down to Devon to watch Hampton take on Torquay United in the Vananrama National League South, whilst the result was not what the Beavers were looking for it was a good day trip for all those who travelled.

The match was far from a classic, with both teams struggling to break each other down, in the end the result was decided by a 28th minute Asa Hall penalty. However Torquay United provided the normal warm welcome to the travelling Beavers.
