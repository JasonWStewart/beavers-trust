 I am a Scot who has lived in London for 20 years. After moving to the local area I fell in love with the Beavers after my first visit in 2016 and have been a fan ever since. I volunteered for several years doing odd jobs around Beveree and making friendSs before being invited onto the Trust Board. I was humbled to be elected following our first democratic elections and I am now more involved than ever in ensuring the fans are at the heart of our warm and welcoming club.
