# Our Board

 **Stefan Rance** - Chair

I've been coming to the home of football since 1989 and been a regular ever since. Over this period I've done, pretty, much all roles that were available from running the bar, producing the programme, being on the committee and board, occasional groundsman and really bad tannoy announcer (seriously check out the worst bits on Andy Eggletons You Tube channel!)

I'm now Secretary of the Youth section and my eldest is currently in the academy. I want the Trust to be representative of the entire supporter base, ensure that our supporters are being given the best Hampton experience there is and work within the community to promote the club and provide help and support where we can to Hampton fans and the much wider community.

Season ticket holder since 2007 and a founder member of the Beavers Trust. Took a lead role in the six figure refurbishment of the main terrace and seating stand.

Served as Trust Chairman for several years and represented the Trust on the main club board in its role as a Corporate Director, and more recently as a personal director. Resigned from that role earlier this year. Previously spent 2 years as Club Covid Officer. Can normally be found helping with matchday parking pre game and with stewarding soon after.

 I am a Scot who has lived in London for 20 years. After moving to the local area I fell in love with the Beavers after my first visit in 2016 and have been a fan ever since. 
 
 I volunteered for several years doing odd jobs around Beveree and making friendSs before being invited onto the Trust Board. I was humbled to be elected following our first democratic elections and I am now more involved than ever in ensuring the fans are at the heart of our warm and welcoming club.

 **James Dean** - Board Member

I’ve been following HRBFC for many years now, and a season ticket holder since 2000.  I enjoy seeing people coming together for a common cause, and am keen to help make the matchday experience to be the best it can be for all supporters.

I’ve been involved in football all my life, originally as a player, and then more recently as a coach for a local youth team, and now as a supporter.  As such, I am keen to actively contribute and give something back to the sport.

I’ve lived in Twickenham for over 20 years, and I work in a regional leadership role in the retail industry.

I am married with two children and divide my footballing allegiance between The Beavers and Manchester United.
